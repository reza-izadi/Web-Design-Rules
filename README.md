## Project Overview

This is a static website project demonstrating web design principles through a fictional "Lisbon Chair Shop" landing page. The project is deployed at [**GitHub Pages**](https://reza-izadi.github.io/Web-Design-Rules/)

The site showcases good design practices including:

- Creating immediate and lasting brand impressions
- Building user trust
- Increasing perceived value
- Providing clear user pathways

## Design Principles Applied

When making changes, maintain these design principles evident in the codebase:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear h1 > h2 > h3 hierarchy with defined font sizes
- **Whitespace**: Generous spacing between sections (96px margin-bottom)
- **Consistency**: Adherence to the spacing and font size systems
- **Depth**: Use of shadows and border-radius for visual layering
- **Brand Colors**: Teal green (`#087f5b`) as primary action color and brand identifier
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML structure with meaningful alt text on images
